The Backend Ruby Engineer is responsible for systems that execute hundreds of millions of API calls every day, powering mission-critical data movement for more than 4,000 enterprise customers worldwide. This is not about tinkering at the edges \u2014 it\u2019s about building production-grade systems where performance, resilience, and reliability are non-negotiable.\n\nRuby is at the heart of our stack, but this role goes far beyond Rails. Engineers here work in an advanced Ruby ecosystem that includes an internal framework, a distributed job system, Redis, Elasticsearch, and deep integrations with providers like S3 and Azure. The challenges span distributed systems, large-scale search, versioning, and security \u2014 the kind of work where Ruby shines when paired with thoughtful engineering. And for those who want to broaden their craft, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to contribute in Golang, Python, Java, and across the stack.\n\nThis is backend engineering at its sharpest: high-impact, high-autonomy work where the code written directly supports some of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands.\n\nYou\u2019ll work with a flat, engineering-first team led by a CEO who is himself an engineer, still deeply involved in technical decisions. You\u2019ll collaborate with peers across infrastructure, frontend, and product \u2014 and you\u2019ll have the authority to dive into any layer of the stack when it makes sense.\n\nAnd unlike siloed roles in big enterprises, you\u2019ll bounce across projects, own meaningful outcomes, and contribute to open-source efforts. Files.com is a flat, high-trust culture where initiative is rewarded and engineers have the freedom to shape their craft.\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe\u2019re Files.com, a profitable, founder-led SaaS company powering secure file transfer and automation for 4,000+ brands you know: Marc Jacobs, GrubHub, Michelin, Hot Topic, Stamps.com, Planet Fitness, KFC, and more.\n\nWe\u2019ve built a $35M+ business with just 70 people by hiring smart, disciplined, high-output teammates who act fast and own outcomes. Backed by $46.5M from Riverwood Capital, we\u2019re scaling intentionally \u2014 and this role is a critical part of that growth.\n\nWhat Makes This Role Different\n\n\u26a1 Beyond Rails: While we started as Ruby on Rails users, our stack is built today on a custom Ruby framework, a custom-built job system (similar to Resque), Redis, Elasticsearch, and integrations with providers like S3 and Azure. You\u2019ll push Ruby to its limits and beyond.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Serious CI/CD: We use GitLab for CI/CD with a sophisticated deployment pipeline on AWS. Engineers ship with confidence, speed, and reliability.\n\n\ud83e\uddea Testing Built for Velocity: Our Ruby stack is wired for productivity. We rely on Bundler for dependency management, RSpec and Minitest for robust testing, and Factory Bot for clean, reliable data setup. Everything is designed to give you speed and confidence in shipping \u2014 testing here accelerates, not slows you down.\n\n\ud83d\udcda World-Class Training & Documentation: Our internal Engineering Training Guide is nearly a million words long, and everything we build is thoroughly documented. You\u2019ll never be stuck without guidance.\n\n\ud83d\udee1 Scale + Reliability: You\u2019ll work on systems that handle hundreds of millions of API calls a day, moving data for thousands of enterprise customers. Testing, reliability, and maintainability aren\u2019t afterthoughts \u2014 they\u2019re the foundation.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Engineer-First Culture: You\u2019ll have an entire engineering team at your back. Files.com is built for engineers, by engineers. Every tool, every system, every process is designed to make you more productive.\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Proven Growth Path: Our engineering managers all grew from within. Many engineers here expand beyond backend into mobile, infrastructure, or platform ownership. The growth path isn\u2019t just open \u2014 it\u2019s expected.\n\nSome Examples of Projects Our Developers Have Recently Completed\n\n*   Universal Metadata Extractor: Built a scalable pipeline that extracts and normalizes metadata from dozens of file types so customers can search, tag, and audit files with precision.\n*   Streaming File Previews: Delivered a system for on-the-fly video and audio previews that stream instantly in-browser.\n*   Job Orchestration Engine: Built a distributed Ruby job system to handle large-scale, parallel file processing with reliability guarantees.\n*   Cross-Cloud Automation: Extended our orchestration engine to support real-time workflows across SharePoint, Box, and Google Drive.\n\nSome Projects Our Developers Will Tackle in the Next 6\u201312 Months\n\n*   AI-Powered Content Discovery: Implementing semantic file search using vector embeddings for meaning-based file discovery.\n*   Zero-Trust File Sharing: Designing ephemeral file access links with advanced device posture and geolocation constraints.\n*   Next-Gen Sync: Rebuilding our sync layer to support multi-directional, conflict-aware synchronization at petabyte scale.\n*   Observability at Scale: Rolling out a monitoring framework with distributed tracing for real-time visibility into file flows and API calls.\n*   Policy as Code: Enabling IT teams to define and enforce security and retention rules in version-controlled code.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Actually Do\n\n*   Ship Production Code in Ruby, Golang, Java, Python, and JavaScript: Write performant, maintainable Ruby that scales\n*   Own Features End-to-End: Design, implement, deploy, and support services\n*   Push Beyond Rails: Work with microservices, Redis, Elasticsearch, proprietary infrastructure, and large-scale integrations\n*   Collaborate Across Teams: Partner with infrastructure, frontend, and product to deliver cohesive systems\n*   Elevate Quality: Contribute to code reviews, documentation, and standards that make the team stronger\n*   Optimize Performance: Identify bottlenecks and build systems that are resilient, fast, and reliable\n\nWho Thrives in This Role\n\n\u2705 Engineers who want to solve;hard scale problems (hundreds of millions of API calls daily).\n\u2705 Builders who care about;clean, maintainable code \u2014 not just getting something to \u201cwork.\u201d\n\u2705 Polyglot thinkers who love Ruby but also want to explore Golang, Python, or full-stack projects.\n\u2705 People who thrive in;high-trust, flat teams where initiative is rewarded, not managed away.\n\u2705 Engineers who enjoy engaging with;open-source and pushing the ecosystem forward.\n\nYour Growth Path\n\nBackend Engineers at Files.com don\u2019t stagnate. Many start in Ruby, then expand into\n\n*   Technical Leadership \u2014 owning major services and mentoring others\n*   Infrastructure/Platform Engineering \u2014 working on orchestration, observability, and deployment systems\n*   Staff/Principal Tracks \u2014 tackling company-wide architecture challenges\n*   Open-Source Impact \u2014 contributing upstream improvements back to the ecosystem\n\nEvery single engineering manager at Files.com was promoted internally. Growth isn\u2019t a promise here \u2014 it\u2019s a proven track record.\n\nPerks & Benefits\n\n\ud83e\ude7a 100% Paid Health, Dental & Vision (75% for family)\n\ud83d\udcb8 401(k) with 4% Company Match\n\ud83d\udcc8 Equity Grants for Every Employee\n\ud83c\udf7c Paid Parental Leave\n\ud83c\udf34 20 PTO Days + 11 Holidays + Full Company Winter Break\n\ud83d\udcb0 $1,000 Signing Bonus + Modern Apple Laptop + Anniversary Gifts\n\u2708\ufe0f Team Travel to NYC, Austin, Nashville, Miami, and more\n\ud83d\udc49 Bottom Line: This is a high-visibility, high-leverage engineering role where your work shapes the backbone of a platform used by thousands of enterprises every day. If you want daily variety, the freedom to explore beyond Ruby, and a fast-growth environment that rewards ownership, this is your seat.\n```"
