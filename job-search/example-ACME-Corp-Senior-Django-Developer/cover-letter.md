Dear ACME Corporation Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Django Developer position at ACME Corporation. With over 15 years of experience architecting scalable Django applications and a proven track record of migrating legacy PHP systems to modern Python architectures, I am excited about the opportunity to lead your digital transformation and help modernize ACME's technology stack.

Your requirement for migrating legacy PHP systems to Django aligns perfectly with my experience at The Penny Hoarder, where I successfully led the migration of their entire e-commerce platform from PHP to Django, serving over 10 million monthly users with zero downtime. Most notably, I optimized the platform's performance from 2.7 seconds to 0.89 seconds—exceeding your sub-1 second page load goal. This optimization directly contributed to increased conversion rates and supported the company's growth from $4M to $40M in annual revenue.

Currently at Headspace, I've been implementing the exact server-driven UI patterns you're seeking for your mobile applications. I led the company-wide SDUI initiative, converting all mobile app display logic to server-side control using Django and TypeScript. Additionally, I've ensured complete GDPR and CCPA compliance across our data handling systems—experience that would immediately benefit ACME's compliance requirements. My work with Braze for marketing automation and integration with payment systems mirrors your needs for third-party payment and shipping API integrations.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong leadership and mentoring capabilities. I currently mentor a team of five junior developers at Headspace and have established comprehensive CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time by 60%. My experience with TDD and agile methodologies would help establish the best practices ACME needs during this critical modernization phase.

I'm particularly drawn to ACME Corporation's innovative spirit and 78-year history of disrupting industries. Your commitment to reliability—"Our products may explode, but our systems never do"—resonates with my approach to building robust, scalable systems. The opportunity to work on mission-critical systems handling millions of transactions daily while maintaining the performance and reliability ACME is known for is exactly the challenge I'm seeking.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with Django, legacy system migrations, and performance optimization can contribute to ACME's digital transformation. I'm available for an interview at your convenience and can provide detailed examples of similar e-commerce platform migrations I've successfully led.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of helping ACME Corporation achieve the impossible—just with better page load times.

Sincerely,  
Branndon Coelho

P.S. - While I can't promise rocket-powered deployments, I can guarantee they'll be faster than a roadrunner and more reliable than an ACME anvil.
