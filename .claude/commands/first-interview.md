## Questions to Ask (First Interview)

**STANDARD QUESTIONS (ALWAYS USE THESE 4 - DO NOT CUSTOMIZE):**

1. **"What's a typical Tuesday look like for someone in this role?"**
   - Gets at real day-to-day work

2. **"How much of this role is directly coding vs meetings/coordination/documentation/planning?"**
   - Critical for meeting preference and work balance

3. **"What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?"**
   - Standard good question for any first interview

4. **"Can you walk me through your on-call rotation and expectations?"**
   - Essential since no on-call is a non-negotiable requirement

**CUSTOMIZED QUESTIONS (CREATE 4 MORE BASED ON THIS SPECIFIC JOB):**

Create 4 additional questions customized to this specific job/company. Match the tone and style of the first 4 - direct, conversational English, no AI/corporate fluff. For example, you might ask about their specific tech stack, company culture concerns, or role expectations, but feel free to ask questions that stand out based on the user's job search criteria and the job listing.

## Notes After Interview

[Space to fill in after interview - what went well, concerns raised, next steps, etc.]
