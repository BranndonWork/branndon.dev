## Critical Global Rules (Apply to ALL tasks)

1. **NEVER fabricate information** - Only use existing, verified content
2. **Use MultiEdit for efficiency** when making multiple changes to files
3. **Preserve exact language** - Don't paraphrase technical content unnecessarily

## Self-Contained Workflow Documents

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each workflow doc below is COMPLETE and SELF-CONTAINED. When doing a specific task, use ONLY the relevant workflow doc - do not reference multiple docs.**

### For Resume Generation
**USE THIS**: `./docs/RESUME_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md`
- Contains EVERYTHING: comprehensive workflow, rules, templates
- Do NOT reference other docs when using this

### For Other Documentation (Reference Only)
- `./docs/` - Contains various project documentation
- List directory first if unsure which doc to use
