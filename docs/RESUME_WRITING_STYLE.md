# Resume Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

### Professional Tone
- **Direct and factual** - State accomplishments clearly without embellishment
- **Action-oriented** - Start sentences with strong action verbs (Led, Designed, Optimized, Implemented)
- **Results-focused** - Include quantifiable metrics whenever possible

### Language Guidelines

#### ✅ DO Use:
- **Active voice**: "Led technical initiatives" not "Technical initiatives were led by me"
- **Specific metrics**: "Optimized performance from 2.7 seconds to 0.89" 
- **Industry terminology**: "Django-based application development", "scalable architecture"
- **Professional accomplishments**: "Contributed to transforming startup from $4M to $40M"
- **Concrete responsibilities**: "Mentor junior engineers", "guide software architecture decisions"

#### ❌ AVOID:
- **Storytelling language**: "My journey began with...", "My tenure there saw..."
- **Overly dramatic phrases**: "driving the IT evolution", "pivotal role"
- **Flowery descriptors**: "impeccable results", "innovative solutions"
- **Personal narrative**: "I'm a seasoned...", "A true believer in..."
- **Vague statements**: "ensuring adherence to industry's best practices" (be specific)

## ATS-Specific Considerations

### Content Structure
- **Lead with credentials** - Years of experience, current role, key technologies
- **Use standard section headers** - Professional Experience, Technical Skills, Education
- **Include relevant keywords** - Match job description terminology naturally
- **Quantify achievements** - Numbers, percentages, timeframes

### Formatting
- **Standard fonts** - Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri (11-14pt)
- **Simple layout** - Single column, no graphics, minimal formatting
- **Clear hierarchy** - Use consistent heading styles
- **Scannable content** - Bullet points, short paragraphs

## Examples

### Before (Storytelling Style):
> "My journey began with driving the IT evolution at The Penny Hoarder from its inception to a recognized media giant. My tenure there saw the orchestration of critical business applications..."

### After (Professional Style):
> "Led technical initiatives at The Penny Hoarder from startup to recognized media platform, orchestrating critical business applications and optimizing site performance from 2.7 seconds to 0.89."

### Before (Dramatic Language):
> "Beyond my technical prowess, I've played a pivotal role in transforming a startup..."

### After (Direct Statement):
> "Contributed to transforming a startup from $4 million to $40 million in annual revenue while scaling technical teams from 10 to over 100 employees."

## Version Control

### Full Resume (Portfolio Version)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive showcase for website visitors
- **Style**: Professional but can include more detail and context
- **Length**: 3-4 pages acceptable
- **Tone**: Confident and detailed

### ATS Resume (Job Application Version)
- **Purpose**: Optimized for applicant tracking systems and recruiters
- **Style**: Concise, keyword-rich, highly scannable
- **Length**: 1-2 pages maximum
- **Tone**: Direct and results-focused

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
- `branndon-coelho-resume.json` - Full portfolio version
- `branndon-coelho-resume-ats.json` - ATS-optimized version
- URL parameter `?mode=ats` switches between versions

### Content Guidelines
- **Consistency** - Same core facts, different presentation
- **Keyword density** - ATS version includes more industry terms
- **Section prioritization** - ATS version emphasizes recent, relevant experience
- **Achievement focus** - Both versions highlight quantifiable results
