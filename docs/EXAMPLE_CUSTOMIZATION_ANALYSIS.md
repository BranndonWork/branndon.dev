# Example Customization Analysis: ACME Corporation

This document analyzes the ACME Corp example to demonstrate proper resume customization methodology.

## What the ACME Example Demonstrates

The ACME Corporation Senior Django Developer application shows how to:

1. **Mirror job posting language while staying truthful to original experience**
   - Used "Senior Django Developer" title since Django is an actual "Very Strong" skill
   - Emphasized server-driven UI because it's an actual Headspace project
   - Highlighted performance optimization using actual 0.89s achievement

2. **Reorganize experience to match requirements without fabricating skills**
   - Moved Django to the front of skills sections
   - Led with most relevant achievements (SDUI, GDPR compliance)
   - Reordered technologies to match job requirements

3. **Emphasize relevant projects from actual work history**
   - Server-Driven UI project at Headspace (real project)
   - Performance optimization from 2.7s to 0.89s (actual achievement)
   - GDPR compliance implementation (documented work)

4. **Use exact metrics from original resume**
   - 0.89s load time achievement (not fabricated)
   - Machine learning email recommendation system (actual project)
   - Specific Headspace projects (DSAR, Ginger integration, etc.)

5. **Show cultural understanding and company knowledge in cover letter**
   - Referenced ACME's cartoon heritage with appropriate humor
   - Showed knowledge of company history and values
   - Connected personal achievements to their stated goals

## Key Corrections Made

The initial ACME example contained fabricated information that was corrected:

### Removed Fabrications:
- "E-commerce expertise" (not in original resume)
- "8+ years Django experience" (original only says "Very Strong")
- "PostgreSQL Optimization Expert" (inflated from actual skill level)
- False dates and technologies not actually used

### Used Only Actual Facts:
- Actual skill levels from original resume
- Real project descriptions from Headspace and Penny Hoarder
- Documented achievements and metrics
- Correct employment dates and technologies

## Methodology Principles

This example demonstrates that effective resume customization:
- **Reorganizes truthful content** rather than fabricating new content
- **Emphasizes relevant experience** without exaggerating skill levels
- **Uses employer's language** when it accurately describes actual experience
- **Maintains professional integrity** while maximizing relevance

The ACME example serves as a template for this truthful, strategic approach to resume customization.
