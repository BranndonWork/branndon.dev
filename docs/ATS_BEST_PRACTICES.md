# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Best Practices

## What ATS Systems Look For

### 1. Keywords Matching
**How it works:** ATS scans for specific keywords from the job description

**Best Practices:**
- Use exact terminology from job posting
- Include both acronyms AND full terms (e.g., "CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)")
- Repeat important keywords 2-3 times naturally throughout resume
- Include technology versions when relevant (Python 3.x, Django 4.0)

### 2. Simple Formatting
**Why it matters:** ATS can't parse complex layouts

**✅ DO:**
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri, Georgia)
- Font size 11-14pt for body text
- Simple bullet points (•, -, *)
- Standard section headers
- Single column layout
- Consistent date formats (MM/YYYY or Month YYYY)

**❌ AVOID:**
- Tables or columns
- Graphics, logos, or images
- Headers and footers
- Text boxes
- Special characters or symbols
- Brackets around text [like this] - confuses parsers
- Fancy fonts or formatting

### 3. Standard Section Headers
**ATS expects these exact or similar headers:**
- Professional Summary / Summary
- Work Experience / Professional Experience / Employment History
- Education
- Skills / Technical Skills
- Certifications (if applicable)

### 4. Contact Information Format
**Required elements:**
- Full Name (largest font, at top)
- Phone Number (with area code)
- Email Address
- City, State (full address not needed)
- LinkedIn URL (optional but recommended)

### 5. Work Experience Structure
**Optimal format for each position:**
```
Job Title | Company Name | Location | Dates (Month YYYY - Month YYYY)
• Achievement-focused bullet point starting with action verb
• Quantifiable result with specific metrics
• Technology or skill used to accomplish task
```

### 6. Achievement Statements
**Formula:** Action Verb + Task + Result + Technology

**Good Example:**
"Led migration from dual source of truth Django and Braze to single source system, eliminating data synchronization issues"

**Why it works:**
- Starts with action verb (Led)
- Specific task (migration from dual to single source)
- Clear result (eliminating sync issues)
- Technologies mentioned (Django, Braze)

### 7. Skills Section
**Best format:**
- Group by category (Languages, Frameworks, Tools)
- List skills with commas or bullets
- Include proficiency levels in plain text, not graphics
- Most important/relevant skills first

**Example:**
```
Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP
Frameworks: Django, React, Flask, Node.js
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
Cloud: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
```

## Common ATS Parsing Errors to Avoid

### 1. Date Confusion
- **Wrong:** 2022-Present, 2022-current, 2022-now
- **Right:** 2022 - Present, January 2022 - Present

### 2. Inconsistent Formatting
- Keep all bullet points the same style
- Use the same date format throughout
- Consistent capitalization for titles

### 3. Hidden Text
- Don't use white text on white background
- Don't hide keywords in tiny fonts
- ATS systems flag this as deceptive

### 4. File Format Issues
- **Best:** .docx or .pdf (text-based, not scanned)
- **Test:** Can you select and copy text? If yes, ATS can read it
- **Avoid:** .jpg, .png, or scanned PDFs

## Keyword Optimization Strategy

### 1. Analyze Job Postings
- Copy 3-5 similar job descriptions
- Identify common keywords and phrases
- Note required vs. preferred qualifications

### 2. Keyword Placement Priority
1. **Professional Summary** - Most important keywords
2. **Recent Job Titles** - Should match target role
3. **Skills Section** - Comprehensive list
4. **Work Experience** - Natural integration in achievements

### 3. Keyword Variations
Include variations of important terms:
- Developer, Software Engineer, Programmer
- Manage, Lead, Direct, Oversee
- Create, Develop, Build, Implement

## Optimizing for Both ATS and Humans

### The Two-Pass Strategy
1. **First Pass (ATS):** Gets you through the filter
   - Keywords matched
   - Proper formatting
   - Clear structure

2. **Second Pass (Human):** Gets you the interview
   - Compelling achievements
   - Clear progression
   - Quantifiable results
   - Professional presentation

### Balance is Key
- Don't keyword stuff - it looks unnatural
- Focus on achievements, not just duties
- Use metrics and specifics
- Tell a coherent career story
