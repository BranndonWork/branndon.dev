**Created**: 2025-09-05  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-05

This document defines my ideal job criteria to help filter opportunities and make consistent decisions during the job search process.

## üéØ Non-Negotiable Requirements

### Compensation

- **Minimum Salary**: $175,000+
- **Excited By**: $225,000+
- **Trade-off**: Would accept lower for exceptional work-life balance (minimal meetings, reduced hours, excellent management)
- **Equity**: Open to equity packages, especially for stable companies with growth potential

### Work Schedule & Life Balance

- **Preferred Hours**: 7am - 3pm Eastern (or fewer total hours)
- **Meeting Preference**: Minimal meetings preferred - would trade salary for fewer meetings
- **On-Call**: No on-call responsibilities
- **PTO**: Adequate vacation time (minimum 15 days, prefer unlimited if genuinely usable)
- **Remote**: Must be remote-friendly (can be hybrid or fully remote)

### Benefits & Security

- **Health Insurance**: Full health insurance coverage required (medical, dental, vision)
- **Job Security**: Stable company with good financial health
- **Management Quality**: Strong, supportive management (avoiding dysfunction and micromanagement)
- **401k**: Company matching preferred

- Django (preferred framework)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL
- RESTful API development
- Git version control

**Strongly Preferred:**

### AI Development Tools Experience

- Claude Code
- ChatGPT/GPT integration
- Cursor IDE
- Google Gemini
- Open to AI-enhanced development workflows

## üè¢ Company Characteristics

### Company Size & Stage

- **Size**: Flexible (10-1000+ employees) if other criteria are met
- **Stage**: Prefer established companies with proven business models
- **Funding**: Stable funding or profitable (avoid pre-revenue startups)

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Recent layoffs or frequent restructuring
- Poor management ratings (below 3.0/5)
- High employee turnover
- Financial instability
- "Move fast and break things" culture without work-life balance
- Excessive meeting culture
- Micromanagement or toxic leadership

### Positive Indicators

- Strong engineering culture
- Focus on code quality and best practices
- Mentorship opportunities
- Clear career progression paths
- Employee development investment
- Stable business model with growth potential
- Good work-life balance ratings (4.0/5+)

## üìà Role Preferences

### Position Levels

- Senior Software Engineer
- Staff Software Engineer
- Application Architect
- Technical Lead
- Backend Engineer (Senior level)

### Responsibilities I Excel At

- Backend system architecture
- Django/Python development
- Team mentorship and code reviews
- API design and development
- Performance optimization
- GDPR/compliance implementation
- Cross-functional collaboration

### Responsibilities to Minimize

- Excessive meeting attendance
- **People management (NO EXCEPTIONS - prefer technical leadership only)**
- On-call rotations
- Frontend-heavy work
- Sales/client-facing responsibilities

### Leadership Role Clarification

**Important Note**: While leadership experience and skills are often listed in job requirements and I'm comfortable having them, **I am not actively seeking leadership-focused positions**. I prefer:

- **Individual contributor roles** with senior-level technical responsibilities
- **Technical mentorship** over people management
- **Happy work environment and job security** over high-visibility leadership opportunities
- **Technical leadership** (architecture, code quality) over organizational leadership

Companies often list "leadership" as a requirement, but this shouldn't automatically make a role more attractive if it comes with cultural instability or management overhead.

## üéØ Decision Framework

### Immediate "Yes" Criteria

- $200k+ salary
- <10 hours of meetings per week
- Strong Python/Django stack
- Excellent management ratings (4.0/5+)
- No on-call requirements
- Stable, profitable company

### Consider Carefully

- $175k-$199k salary range
- Mixed tech stack with some Python
- Growing company with good fundamentals
- Moderate meeting requirements

### Automatic "No" Criteria

- <$175k salary (unless exceptional circumstances)
- **Any people management responsibilities (Manager, Engineering Manager, Team Lead with direct reports)**
- No Python in tech stack
- Recent layoffs or financial troubles
- Poor management ratings (<3.0/5)
- Required on-call responsibilities
- Excessive meeting culture (>20 hours/week)

## üìù Interview Questions to Always Ask

1. What's a typical Tuesday look like for someone in this role?
2. How much of this role is directly coding vs meetings/coordination/documentation/planning?
3. What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?
4. Can you walk me through your on-call rotation and expectations?
5. What's your approach to work-life balance?
6. How do you handle performance reviews and career growth?
7. What's the meeting culture like here?

## üîç Research Priorities

When evaluating companies, always check:

- Recent employee reviews (last 6-12 months)
- Layoff history and financial stability
- Management quality ratings
- Work-life balance scores
- Salary transparency on Glassdoor/Levels.fyi
- Company news and funding status

## üìä Tracking Notes

Use this criteria to score opportunities consistently:

- **Green Light** (9-10/10): Meets all non-negotiables plus most preferences
- **Yellow Light** (7-8/10): Meets non-negotiables with some trade-offs
- **Red Light** (<7/10): Missing key requirements or too many compromises
